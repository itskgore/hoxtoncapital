For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of the Agreement.</p>

If that occurs, Wedge is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Wedge agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Wedge therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (&ldquo;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference&rdquo;). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you also agree to participate in the conference.<br><br>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing. Notice to Wedge that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:clientportal-support@hoxtoncapital.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">clientportal-support@hoxtoncapital.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at Wedge Fintech LLC, 501 Congress Ave, Suite 150, Austin, TX 78701.The Notice must include: (a) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (b) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (c) a description of your Dispute. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party&rsquo;s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p>

Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the Section 14.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section 14.4 are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Wedge agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in Travis County in the State of Texas. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Wedge from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>

The Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect; 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of Notice, you and Wedge agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under \$250,000, not inclusive of attorneys&rsquo; fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS&rsquo;s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable JAMS rules. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the &ldquo;Request&rdquo;). The Request must include: (a) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (b) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (c) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (d) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (e) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel&rsquo;s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel&rsquo;s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. Unless you and Wedge otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Section 14.9 is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. You and Wedge agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties&rsquo; attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p>

If you or Wedge need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration.
